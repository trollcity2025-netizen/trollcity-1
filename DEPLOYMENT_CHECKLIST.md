## ⏳ DEPLOYMENT STEPS (IN ORDER)

### Step 1: Database Migrations (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)

Run these SQL files in Supabase SQL Editor:

#### A. OG Badge Migration
```bash
# File: supabase/migrations/20251126_add_og_badge.sql
```
**What it does:**
- Adds `og_badge` column to user_profiles
- Creates trigger to auto-grant OG badge to users created before 2026-01-01
- Updates all existing users with OG badge

#### B. Critical Tables Migration
```bash
# File: supabase/migrations/20251126_critical_pre_launch.sql
```
**What it does:**
- Creates revenue_settings table (with defaults)
- Creates risk management tables (user_risk_profile, risk_events)
- Creates broadcaster_earnings table
- Creates officer tables (officer_actions, officer_earnings)
- Sets up RLS policies
- Seeds revenue settings

**How to run:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy entire content of `20251126_add_og_badge.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify success (should see "Success. No rows returned")
5. Copy entire content of `20251126_critical_pre_launch.sql`
6. Click "Run"
7. Verify success - should see table row counts

**Expected Output:**
```
revenue_settings    | 1
user_risk_profile   | 0
risk_events         | 0
broadcaster_earnings| 0
officer_actions     | 0
officer_earnings    | 0
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in production:

```env
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://yjxpwfalenorzrqxwmtr.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon_key>
SUPABASE_URL=https://yjxpwfalenorzrqxwmtr.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service_role_key>

# Square (PRODUCTION)
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<production_token>
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sq0idp-CrLUQ0nBsGw514BdmRCKcw
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=LC50JZXVG8F0M
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sq0idp-CrLUQ0nBsGw514BdmRCKcw
VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=LC50JZXVG8F0M
VITE_SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<production_token>

# Agora
