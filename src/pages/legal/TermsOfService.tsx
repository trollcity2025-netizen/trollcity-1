        <p>
          These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the Troll
          City platform, websites, applications, and related services (&quot;Troll City&quot;,
          &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;). By creating an account or using Troll City, you agree
          to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 16 years old, or the minimum age of digital consent in
          your jurisdiction, to use Troll City. If you are under 18, you may only use
          Troll City with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. You agree to keep
          your registration information accurate and secure and understand that you are
          responsible for all activity under your account.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City is an interactive entertainment platform that uses virtual
          currency (&quot;Coins&quot;) and digital gifts. It is not a gambling platform and does
          not guarantee any financial returns. Certain users may be eligible to request
          payouts based on Paid Coin balances, subject to these Terms and our review.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Virtual Currency and Digital Items</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City may offer Free Coins, troll_coins, and promotional Coins. Coins and
          digital gifts are licenses to use features inside Troll City and have no
          inherent real-world value, except where we explicitly allow payouts of Paid
          Coins through our official payout process. We may update exchange structures,
          conversion eligibility, and coin mechanics at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Purchases and Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Purchases of Coins and digital items are generally final and non-refundable,
          except where required by law. Chargebacks or fraudulent activity may result
          in suspension or termination of your account and reversal of associated
          transactions.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payouts and Taxes</h2>
        <p>
          Only eligible users may request a payout. At minimum, you must hold at least{' '}
          <strong>12,000 troll_coins</strong>, complete our identity verification, and
          comply with all rules. Payouts are not guaranteed, may be processed manually,
          and are subject to review. You are solely responsible for any taxes related
          to income or benefits you receive from Troll City.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Loans, Credit Cards, and Asset Repossession</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>6.1 Troll Bank Loans:</strong> Users may apply for loans through the Troll Bank system. All loans must be repaid according to the agreed terms. Failure to make payments for 30 days or more constitutes a default.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.2 Credit Cards:</strong> Credit cards may be issued to eligible users based on credit score and account standing. All credit card charges include an 8% finance fee. Credit cards may only be used for approved purchases (Coin Store items, vehicles) and cannot be used for peer-to-peer transfers, gifts, or rent payments. Credit card debt must be repaid promptly to maintain good standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.3 Property and Vehicle Loans:</strong> Properties and vehicles purchased on credit remain subject to the loan agreement until paid in full. Missed payments or defaults may result in repossession.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.4 Repossession Rights:</strong> By using Troll City&apos;s financial services, you explicitly agree that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loan Defaults:</strong> If you fail to make loan payments for 30 consecutive days, Troll City reserves the right to repossess any properties or vehicles purchased with loan funds or owned by you to satisfy the debt.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit Card Defaults:</strong> If your credit card debt exceeds your credit limit or remains unpaid for 60 days, Troll City reserves the right to repossess your properties and/or vehicles to satisfy the outstanding balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Rent Defaults:</strong> Property owners who fail to pay rent, utilities, or property-related fees for 30 days may have their properties foreclosed and transferred to the Public Pool or repossessed by administrators.</li>
          <li><strong>Court Summons:</strong> Defaults on any financial obligation may result in automatic court summons, fines, or legal action within the Troll City judicial system.</li>
          <li><strong>No Refunds on Repossessed Assets:</strong> Repossessed assets may be sold, auctioned, or redistributed. No refunds or compensation will be provided for repossessed items beyond what is required to satisfy the debt.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit Score Impact:</strong> Defaults, missed payments, and repossessions will negatively impact your credit score, affecting future loan eligibility and financial opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>6.5 Asset Recovery:</strong> If you pay off your debt in full after repossession, you may petition administrators for asset restoration, subject to review and approval. Restoration is not guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6.6 Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for managing your finances, making timely payments, and understanding the terms of any credit extended to you. Troll City is not responsible for financial losses resulting from defaults or repossessions.
          You&apos;re also responsible for making sure that any information you provide us is accurate and that you have the right to provide it.
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Conduct and Content</h2>
        <p>
          You may not use Troll City to harass, threaten, exploit, or harm others, to
          promote hate or illegal activity, or to share infringing or explicit content.
          We may remove content or restrict accounts that violate our policies or
          applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within Troll City, we allow broader personal expression with clear boundaries.
          Men may appear shirtless or in underwear; women may appear in shirts with
          underwear. No explicit sexual content is allowed. Genitals must never be
          exposed or visibly aroused. Do not touch or simulate touching of intimate
          body parts while live.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Safety, Moderation, and Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City uses a combination of automated tools and human moderators,
          including Troll Officers, to help keep the platform safe. We may review,
          restrict, or remove content and accounts at our discretion. Troll City is not
          an emergency service; in emergencies, contact local authorities directly.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City and its logos, artwork, virtual items, and software are protected
          by intellectual property laws. You must not use our marks or assets without
          prior written permission and must not upload content that infringes others&apos;
          rights.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City is provided &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; without warranties of any
          kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect
          or consequential damages or for any amount greater than the fees you paid to
          us in the six months before the claim, or USD $100, whichever is greater.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Termination and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          You may stop using Troll City at any time. We may suspend or terminate your
          access at any time, with or without notice, including for suspected
          violations of these Terms. We may update these Terms periodically; continuing
          to use Troll City after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the
          revised Terms.
