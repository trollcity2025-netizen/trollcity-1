        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Troll
          City platform, websites, applications, and related services ("Troll City",
          "we", "us", or "our"). By creating an account or using Troll City, you agree
          to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 16 years old, or the minimum age of digital consent in
          your jurisdiction, to use Troll City. If you are under 18, you may only use
          Troll City with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. You agree to keep
          your registration information accurate and secure and understand that you are
          responsible for all activity under your account.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City is an interactive entertainment platform that uses virtual
          currency ("Coins") and digital gifts. It is not a gambling platform and does
          not guarantee any financial returns. Certain users may be eligible to request
          payouts based on Paid Coin balances, subject to these Terms and our review.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Virtual Currency and Digital Items</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City may offer Free Coins, Paid Coins, and promotional Coins. Coins and
          digital gifts are licenses to use features inside Troll City and have no
          inherent real-world value, except where we explicitly allow payouts of Paid
          Coins through our official payout process. We may update exchange structures,
          conversion eligibility, and coin mechanics at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Purchases and Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Purchases of Coins and digital items are generally final and non-refundable,
          except where required by law. Chargebacks or fraudulent activity may result
          in suspension or termination of your account and reversal of associated
          transactions.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payouts and Taxes</h2>
        <p>
          Only eligible users may request a payout. At minimum, you must hold at least{' '}
          <strong>7,000 Paid Coins</strong>, complete our identity verification, and
          comply with all rules. Payouts are not guaranteed, may be processed manually,
          and are subject to review. You are solely responsible for any taxes related
          to income or benefits you receive from Troll City.
        </p>

        <h2>6. User Conduct and Content</h2>
        <p>
          You may not use Troll City to harass, threaten, exploit, or harm others, to
          promote hate or illegal activity, or to share infringing or explicit content.
          We may remove content or restrict accounts that violate our policies or
          applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Safety, Moderation, and Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City uses a combination of automated tools and human moderators,
          including Troll Officers, to help keep the platform safe. We may review,
          restrict, or remove content and accounts at our discretion. Troll City is not
          an emergency service; in emergencies, contact local authorities directly.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City and its logos, artwork, virtual items, and software are protected
          by intellectual property laws. You must not use our marks or assets without
          prior written permission and must not upload content that infringes others'
          rights.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Troll City is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any
          kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect
          or consequential damages or for any amount greater than the fees you paid to
          us in the six months before the claim, or USD $100, whichever is greater.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Termination and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          You may stop using Troll City at any time. We may suspend or terminate your
          access at any time, with or without notice, including for suspected
          violations of these Terms. We may update these Terms periodically; continuing
          to use Troll City after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the
          revised Terms.
        </p>
